Instructions for interviewers and interviewees, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY! 

Start by introducing yourselves and why you're all here. Try to settle into the role-playing scenario without giving it too much thought. Try your best not to break character and take this seriously. The more you joke around or take this lightly, the less benefit this exercise and workshop will yield. Let's all try to be as productive as possible, so if one of you breaks character, the other should remain cool and not feed into it. 

Having any kind of undue outburst like you would in the cohort will cost you your job opportunity and send you back to applying, so we're not tolerating any bull-shitting today. Be your genuine self while staying professional.

Take notes, record yourself, have someone listen to you and take notes for your feedback later, etc.

We're all here to show support for each other so keep it respectful!

Tell me about a time where you were faced with a deadline and how you dealt with it?

Tell me about a time when you and a team member had a disagreement on a project and how you came to an agreement?

Describe a time where you had to deal with an unreasonable expectation?

This is just another set of questions, you can do either or both, totally up to you.
Mock interview questions:

Tell me about yourself

What are you looking for in terms of your career?

Tell me about your most challenging project and what you did to complete it.

What’s your salary range?


Open breakout rooms and pair people together randomly
Decide what kind of role you’re meant to be applying to and keep it in mind when asking/ answering questions, we are all potentially going for specific roles so try to prepare for those interviews intentionally in this workshop
Potentially open by being the guinea pig and letting them interview me while the rest watch and vice versa
After demonstrating how I want things to go, invite them to join their breakout rooms and begin their session
Interviewers should be taking notes to give feedback to the interviewee
Aim to have 1:30 min long answers, this is usually a sweet spot where if you go under it’s not enough details/ context and too much longer will just bore your interviewer and you will likely meander in a stupid direction just filling the silence
Read the room and give silence when necessary, at other times maybe prompt your interviewee, or ask your interviewer clarifying questions
